# Lane-Line-Detection-with-CV  
## AIM:  
The objective of the program given is to perform edge detection of images in real-time.  
## Strategy:  
1. *Applying Canny Detector* : It is an edge detection operator that uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images.  
2. *Frame Masking* : To detect markings in the lane, we need to mask the rest part of the frame and for this we are using frame masking.  
3. *Hough Transform* : The Hough transform is a feature extraction technique used in image analysis, computer vision, and digital image processing.  
4. *Visualization* : The lane is visualized as two light green lines, linearly fitted polynomials which will be overlayed on our input frame.
